## Providers

- SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. [more here](https://sqlite.org/index.html) 
- SQL CE is a discontinued but still useful relational database produced by Microsoft for applications that run on mobile devices and desktops. [more here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30709)
- SQL Server Express Edition is a scaled down, free edition of SQL Server, which includes the core database engine. [more here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=101064)
- MS Access is a database management system (DBMS) from Microsoft that combines the relational Access Database Engine (ACE) with a graphical user interface and software-development tools. [more here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/access)


## System requirements

- You need [VC++ 2019 Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) 32-bit and 64-bit versions

- You will need .NET 6.

- You need to install the version of VC++ Runtime that Baby Browser needs. Since we are using CefSharp 106, according to [this](https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/#release-branches) we need the above versions
